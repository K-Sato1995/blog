I was looking for a different frontend framework that <strong>dose not</strong> use Virtual DOM to have more diverse skills under my belt.</p>\n<p>I was always curious about <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> and heard actually a lot of good things about it from people around me.</p>\n<p>So I tried it out.</p>\n<h2>Svelte</h2>\n<p>There are already many posts about <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> by other people and reading the official document should be enough to start making stuff with it.</p>\n<p>The syntax was very straightforward and I liked it a lot.</p>\n<h2>Sveltekit</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\">official document</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vite</h2>\n<p>Sveltekit internally uses <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\">Vite</a> as its build tool.</p>\n<p>This surely provided the <code>faster and leaner</code> experince It promised. The <code>HMR</code> was absolutely instantaneous.</p>\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n<p>I also tried <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">vercel</a> to host this blog. Hosting the site was extremely simple and easy. Setting the custom domain also was easy. Probably the best hosting service I've used so far.</p>\n<h2>Other stuff</h2>\n<p>I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/K-Sato1995/md-to-json-converter\">package</a> that converts markdown files into JSON for this.</p>\n",

And I've been using that time to code. And I feel like I've kinda rediscovered love and passion for coding.</p>\n<h2>Background info</h2>\n<p>I've been coding for the last 5 ~ 6 years according to my GitHub profile ,I know it's not that long, and been coding professionally for the last 4 years. To be honest, I consider myself very hard working and diligent. But I noticed that I kinda didn't code or study that much outside of my job for the last few months. And there was an event that made me question why I'm working as a software engineer and if this occupation is actually a good fit for me. So I tried to remember why I chose this career path.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32632542/158554737-cecb172a-7f1e-4144-a452-c26fe60420c1.gif\" alt=\"200\"></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The conclusion I came to was that I like creating random stuff. But lately I've been so caught up with very complicated stuff like &quot;algorithms&quot;, &quot;performance&quot;, &quot;best practices&quot;....etc. Not saying I don't like the stuff. I actually love making web sites faster or making my code cleaner...etc. I was simply so caught up with it and coding kinda became something I didn't necessarily enjoy.</p>\n<p>So I just started creating random stuff for myself without thinking too much about the &quot;complecated&quot; stuff.</p>\n<p>This blog is one of those things I've recently created. It's not the fastest site in the world or best looking site in the world or anything. But it is something I personally like and something that represents myself. And ,most importantly, it is something I really enjoyed creating. While I was working on the things I've made lately, I just wanted to use all my time working on those things. And I think that is true passion.</p>\n<p>I am glad that I could remember the reason why I like what I do. I would like to keep coding and keep getting better. And hopefully I will never forget why I like coding and always continue to feel passionate about it.</p>\n",

As an Asian myself, it is very exciting for me to watch Asian players play in the big league. And there are two absolutely unbelievable Japanese players in MLB right now.</p>\n<p>The first player I want to mention here is the 2021 AL MVP and<a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">Shohei Ohtani</a>.<br>\nAnd the second one is <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/seiya-suzuki-673548\">Seiya Suzuki</a> who has just started his first season in MLB.</p>\n<h2>Shohei Ohtani</h2>\n<p>I feel like there really is no need for me to talk about this guy. He is already very well known among baseball fans. It seems like he is struggling a bit this season but after all, this is the guy who, IMHO, had the best season of all time in the last season. So I'm sure he will do just fine as long as he stays healthy.</p>\n<p>You can check out the stats and awards he received in the links below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">stats on mlb.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/shohei-ohtani-660271\">awards on mlb.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Seiya Suzuki</h2>\n<p>Before I say anything about him, just check out his stats as of now (2022/04/21).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>2022</th><th style=\"text-align:center\">AB</th><th>R</th><th>H</th><th>HR</th><th>RBI</th><th>AVG</th><th>OPS</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Stats</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">31</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>.387</td><td>1.404</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>(This is his first season in MLB)</p>\n<p>His OPS is a staggering 1.404ü§Øü§Ø!! Granted, he has only played in 9 games and I'm sure his will go through difficult moments in the season and the stats will go down. But I honestly didn't expect him to start off the season so well. As stated above, this is the first season ever in MLB which is arguably by far the best baseball league in the world.</p>\n<p>As I said, he has only played in a few games but I'm already totally sold on this dude(His swing is so smooth and beautiful). I really can't wait to see what kind of stats he will have at the end of the season.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you are wondering what kind of person Seiya Suzuki is off the field, this video says about his personality more than I ever could.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-Wf-jVSe6w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reporter: ‚ÄúIs there any meaning behind choosing #27?‚Äù<br>\nSeiya Suzuki: ‚ÄúMike Trout...
